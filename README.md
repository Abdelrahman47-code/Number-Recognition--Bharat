# Number-Recognition--Bharat

Aspiring to explore the world of deep learning and enhance my skills, I embarked on a captivating journey to create a powerful digit recognition model using the famous MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of building, training, and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits.

## Overview

This project aims to accurately recognize handwritten digits using a deep learning approach. The MNIST dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of digits from 0 to 9. The project explores various techniques such as data augmentation, learning rate scheduling, dropout regularization, early stopping, and more to improve the model's accuracy and generalization.

This hands-on project in digit recognition using deep learning was an exhilarating experience. The use of various techniques, coupled with model evaluation and interactive visualizations, enabled the creation of a robust digit recognition model. The project serves as a stepping stone for exploring deep learning applications and continues to inspire further exploration in the world of AI.

This is one of my tasks as a Data Science Intern at the virtual internship from [**Bharat Intern**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bharat-intern).
